# PPSF-A-Privacy-Preserving-Service-Framework-for-TSP
We face privacy leakage when the TSP neural combinatorial optimization model and userâ€™s data are directly outsourced to a cloud platform to provide or request service. In order to address the issue,  we design a privacy-preserving service framework for a TSP-based neural combinatorial optimization network called PPSF.
